            #Introduction
In the tough telecom sector, keeping current clients is just as important as attracting new
ones. High churn rates raise the cost of acquiring new customers and cause significant
revenue losses. In order to help the business allocate resources efficiently and create focused
retention tactics, this project intends to provide a predictive machine learning solution that
will identify customers who are likely to leave.
           #Problem Statement
1. Find High-Risk Clients: Identify the clients who are most likely to leave, enabling
focused interventions.
2. Recognise Churn Drivers: Examine characteristics and trends that affect customers'
decisions to leave, such as poor service, excessive expenses, or low engagement.
3. Create Successful Retention Programs: To increase customer satisfaction and loyalty,
adjust marketing tactics, boost service offerings, and respond to consumer concerns.
           #This project aims to:
1. Use transactional, behavioural, and demographic data about your customers to
forecast turnover.
2. Give practical advice for developing customer retention plans.
          #Objectives
Create a churn prediction machine learning model that is both accurate and efficient.
To obtain important insights, examine the connection between churn and client attributes.
